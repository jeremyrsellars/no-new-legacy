        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>I came by this blog post, <a href="http://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html">Software Ninja Class Hierarchy</a>, via a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor">Corey House (@housecor)</a>.  I started reading this on Friday, re-reading it on Saturday, and again today.  I guess you could say <em>it captured my attention</em>.  I found myself agreeing with the author (Terence McGhee).  This is the first I've known of the man and I like what I've read so far.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The Terence McGhee Software Ninja Class Hierarchy</h3>

<p>In short, it proposes the "Terence McGhee Software Ninja Class Hierarchy" for classifying software developers based on their professionalism in the field.  In short, the 9 classes range from "Chump Coders" like me when I came out of college, to "Gurus" like Martin Fowler and Uncle Bob Martin.  Each class has a "why an employer might be interested" section and a "Battle cry" (think motto).  Also, in the higher levels, Terence lists some dangers in hiring the higher levels.  The sections on benefit to the employer could be valuable while forming team(s) by merging and hiring.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">"Chump Coder?"</h3>

<p>As you might imagine from a class named "Chump Coder," it isn't meant to be flattering.  It seems to be an honest evaluation of skills and value each class brings to the team (to quote Terence, "It should be noted that many a profitable product has been brought to market using only Chump Coders.").  I would advise anyone who wants to read it to leave their "Software Engineer â€“ Level 3" titles at the door because this class system isn't about experience.  Instead, it is about the <strong>maintainability</strong> of the software produced.  Take me for example, for most of my career I was a variant of lowest class - "Chump coder."  At the time, I think I would have been offended. Now, after reading <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code">Clean Code</a>, by Robert C. (Uncle Bob) Martin, I recognize it and humbly agree.  (So, please consider this a formal apology to the team now maintaining the code I wrote back then).</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Why Read?</h3>

<p>I think there could be considerable value in reading this, which is why I'm bringing it to your attention.  It might serve as a road map to help you know where your team members stand and how to help them achieve their potential.  I think it is worth mentioning that there are other important attributes, like customer service ability, communication ability, etc., and Terence did discuss this a little.</p>

<p>Consider reading if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You (or people you know) are pursuing clean code.</li>
<li>You are involved in recruiting for a software development team.</li>
</ul>
