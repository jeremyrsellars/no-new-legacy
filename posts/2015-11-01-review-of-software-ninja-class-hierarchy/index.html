<p>I came by this blog post, <a href="http://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html">Software Ninja Class Hierarchy</a>, via a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor">Corey House (@housecor)</a>.  I started reading this on Friday, re-reading it on Saturday, and again today.  I guess you could say <em>it captured my attention</em>.  I found myself agreeing with the author (Terence McGhee).  This is the first I&#39;ve known of the man and I like what I&#39;ve read so far.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The Terence McGhee Software Ninja Class Hierarchy</h3>

<p>In short, it proposes the &quot;Terence McGhee Software Ninja Class Hierarchy&quot; for classifying software developers based on their professionalism in the field.  In short, the 9 classes range from &quot;Chump Coders&quot; like me when I came out of college, to &quot;Gurus&quot; like Martin Fowler and Uncle Bob Martin.  Each class has a &quot;why an employer might be interested&quot; section and a &quot;Battle cry&quot; (think motto).  Also, in the higher levels, Terence lists some dangers in hiring the higher levels.  The sections on benefit to the employer could be valuable while we re-form team(s) by merging and hiring.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">&quot;Chump Coder?&quot;</h3>

<p>As you might imagine from a class named &quot;Chump Coder,&quot; it isn&#39;t meant to be flattering.  It seems to be an honest evaluation of skills and value each class brings to the team (to quote Terence, &quot;It should be noted that many a profitable product has been brought to market using only Chump Coders.&quot;).  I would advise anyone who wants to read it to leave their &quot;Software Engineer – Level 3&quot; titles at the door because this class system isn&#39;t about experience.  Instead, it is about the <strong>maintainability</strong> of the software produced.  Take me for example, for most of my career I was a variant of lowest class - &quot;Chump coder.&quot;  At the time, I think I would have been offended. Now, after reading Clean Code, I recognize it and humbly agree.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Why Read?</h3>

<p>I think there could be considerable value in reading this, which is why I&#39;m bringing it to your attention.  It might serve as a road map to help you know where your team members stand and how to help them achieve their potential.  I think it is worth mentioning that there are other important attributes, like customer service ability, communication ability, etc., and Terence did discuss this a little.</p>

<p>I have included my own personal timeline for reference, but it would be rather meaningless without reading the article, so I suggest reading the article first.  </p>

<h3 id="toc_3">My Timeline</h3>

<p>I would describe my ninja-class through the years like this (with approximate dates -- it&#39;s difficult to remember that far back).</p>

<ul>
<li><em>1993-2002</em> - Chump Coder – VB, languages learned during college coursework</li>
<li><em>2002-2004</em> - Expanded Chump Coder – VB, C#</li>
<li><em>2005-2010</em> - Expanded Chump Coder, Specialist C#</li>
<li><em>2010-2014</em> - Initiate (thanks to Uncle Bob)</li>
<li><em>2014-2015</em> - Code smith – level 1 (on a good day, when it&#39;s new development instead of maintenance)</li>
</ul>
